# Dapper.Advisor

This tool contains analyzers that offer guidance on Dapper usage; it is
included as part of Dapper.AOT, but can also offer guidance in isolation. The tool requires
up-to-date build-tools (we can consider trying to re-package things for older build-tools if
feedback suggests this is a common thing).

All feedback / questions / etc - see [DapperAOT](https://github.com/DapperLib/DapperAOT/).

Note that the advanced SQL analysis tools are limited to SQL Server
currently, via `SqlConnection`.
